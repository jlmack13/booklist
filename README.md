#Book List Challenge

##Overview
Welcome! If you are a bookworm looking to keep track of all the books you read
then you are in the right place, because that is exactly what this app does.


##How To Install The App
In your terminal execute the following commands:

run `bundle install`

run `rake:db/migrate`

run `shotgun`

Then navigate to http://localhost:9393/


##How To Use The App

Once the app is running, if you have an account already all you need to do it log in.
Otherwise sign up from the link on the homepage.

Once you are logged in, to add a book click on the "Add Book" button. Enter the information
you'd like (title is required) and click the "Add Book" button (or the "Cancel" button, if
you've changed your mind).

To edit or delete a book, click on the desired book in your book list to be taken to the details
page for that book. To edit the book, click the "Edit Book" button and make your changes
(don't forget to save them!). To delete the book, click the "Delete" button. WARNING: This cannot be undone.
